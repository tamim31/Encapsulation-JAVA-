# Encapsulation-JAVA-


Key features of encapsulation in Java:
            
            1.Data Hiding:
                         Achieved by declaring variables as private within a class.
                         Prevents direct access from outside the class.
                         Ensures data security and controlled access.

           2.Access Methods (Getters and Setters):
                         Public methods provided within the class to interact with the encapsulated data.
                         Getters (accessors): Retrieve the values of private variables.
                         Setters (mutators): Modify the values of private variables, often with validation logic.
